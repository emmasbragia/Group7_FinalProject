**Sprint Review:**

1. What did you learn from doing our third sprint?
Doing this third sprint really taught us how to work under pressure when things start throwing a bunch of bugs and errors. Now that we were in our final stage of building the website and tackling all the functionality things, there were so many issues we ran into. From cards not organizing, to information from firebase not pulling and more, it was a lot of work, a bit more than we expected. However, we really learned a lot about how to handle these things and work together and code together more efficiently.


2. What did go well? Why?
There were times when we gathered into the same room and coded together. This way everyone was able to theorize how to best code something when it wasn’t working. We bounced off ideas, tested various theories and coded things in the best way possible. 


3. What didn’t go well? Why not?
I think there were a lot of additional minor features we wanted to add at the last minute because we got ambitious and while we thought they wouldn't take long, they took much longer and there were things we had to cancel adding because of the time crunch.


4. How can you make things better next time?
If we were to have another sprint, i think we would first start by making a list of all the features we wanted to add and stick to it, no extra features being added at the last minute no matter how much we want it. This way we can focus on the most important features. 


5. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
Yes, we are very satisfied with the work we have completed. We think the website came along very nicely and the client is very pleased. From now till the submission date, we just have very few organizational things to do like resizing images, putting things in a table and such. 


6. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?

Sprint Review done by Group 5. Signed off by Peilan Zhang.
"We were present for the Sprint Review with Group 7. Everyone was present from their team. We really like their website. We think it looks very easy on the eyes and goes well with HASA’s theme. We like how it uses light colors for easy readability and they make use of many images. The organization of the website is also simple and easy to follow. The functionality they added to their events and inventory button, which they shared was something they struggled with, ended up coming together well and they were able to find solutions together. Overall, Group 7 did a good job. "
