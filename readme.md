**Daily Scrum:** 

Meeting Evidence #1:
1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What are you planning to do today?
3. Any problems are you facing?

    Akshada:
    - We met to discuss our plan for this sprint and what we wanted to get done. We decided to focus on two tabs and work towards getting those done to a large extent.
    - We set up trello and the burndown chart since we had issues with that last time. We also assigned responsibilities on who is going to be responsible for what.
    - no problems as of now.
    
    Emma:
    -  We met to discuss the plan for the sprint and breakout timing of activities.
    - Roles were assigned so I planned on creating tabs and allowing them to switch between pages. 
    - No problems. 

    Inaki:
    - 
    - 
    -  

    Lajzoo:
    - Met with the HASA Chair to better assess design and what is wanted for implementation.
    - Putting together another draft in JustInMind to satisfy HASA's Chairs requests.
    - Translating requests from HASA Chair into simplified and accomplishable things I know the whole team is capable of implementing.

    Yasmine:
    - Discussed what we would build off of from the first sprint
    - Created Trello board and started working on estimations  
    -  N/a
    
Meeting Evidence #2:

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What are you planning to do today?
3. Any problems are you facing?

    Akshada:
    - We began working on the inventory tab. We discussed how to best approach this to creatively display the information but also how to pull it from the database code wise.
    - We continued to build the website and work on the inventory tab as well as the other tabs.
    - Just some code issues with getting the inventory tab to work the way we want. We should be able to figure it out soon. 
    
    Emma:
    - I created all the tabs so we could start building out the inventory and member tabs.  
    - I will be creating a profile tab so members can update their personal information. 
    - No problems. 

    Inaki:
    - 
    -  
    -  

    Lajzoo:
    - Fixed up the designs even more so the whole team is aware of what exactly will be implemented and how it should be done.
    - Sharing with the HASA Chair our actual work done with the website based off of the new designs in JustInMind before. 
    - Ensuring the HASA Chair that our current work is still a prototype and that web design will come after we make sure it is first functional.

    Yasmine:
    - Discussed best way to set up inventory tab and how to present the 'meet the org' tab
    - Added more to the Trello board as we assigned and created more tasks
    -  N/a


**Sprint Review:**

1. What did you learn from doing our second sprint?

We learned how to better work together as a team and build a website together. Last time we took a divide and conquer approach but this time we were working more cohesively and coding together. We were in contact with each other more and shared any new ways that we figured out how to do things more efficiently. 

2. What did go well? Why?

Using outside tools and resources really helped us speed up the process, especially since we had a lot of data that needed to be entered into our database. It allowed us to focus more on coding rather than importing and manually entering in data. 

3. What didn’t go well? Why not?

As a group there wasn’t anything that was bad but sometimes pushing code would take a long time because of how much there was so this kind of forced the other team members to wait before they begin coding to avoid many conflicts when pushing. There isn’t much that can be done. We just kind of let each other know when we are done pushing so other people can start.

4. How can you make things better next time?

I think everything that we did this time worked great. We got a lot of what we wanted completed and there weren’t a lot of issues we ran into. We learned things from the first sprint and implemented them. I think we just continue to do as we are and make changes along the way as issues or obstacles arise.

5. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?

Yes. I think our group made some really good progress. We worked on exactly the things we planned and made some minor adjustments to our design but nothing too different from our prototypes. I think if we continue working at this pace we will get the project done on time.

6. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?

Sprint Review done by Group 5. Signed off by Peilan Zhang.

"We were present during the sprint review for Group 7. Everyone from Group 7 was in attendance during the meeting. We looked over their progress and their website is coming together great. Compared to the last sprint review, their website has a lot more elements to it. We liked how they used cards to display information than create a simple table. We think taht was a really creative way. it also makes reading information more clear. There is some great progress being made and we look forward to seeing their final product."
